# 3.1 Radial-basis function networks

- What is the lower bound for the number of training examples, $N$?

- What happens with the error if $N = n$? Why?

- Under what conditions, if any, does (4) have a solution in this case?

- During training we use an error measure defined over the training examples. Is it good to use this measure when evaluating the performance of the network? Explain!

# 4.1 Batch mode training using least squares

-  How many units did you require to get down to a maximum (absolute) residual value of 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001?

- Give a good reason for the big difference in residual between 5 and 6 units for $sin(2x)$.

- How many units did you require, when approximating $square(2 ∗ x)$, to come down to residual values of 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001?

- Approximating $square(2 ∗ x)$ is a somewhat special case of function approximation since it is similar to another area of use for artificial neural networks. Which?

- Can you, with a suitable action (e.g. transforming network output), easy get down (for training values) to a residual value=0? What action? How many units did you require?

- Can an RBF network solve the XOR problem? If not, explain why not. If yes, explain how.
